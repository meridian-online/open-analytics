-- Build the tiered, multi-grain edge set: one row per asserted identity, keyed by a
-- typed SEC identifier (cik | series | class). Tiers, in precedence order:
--   authoritative  — deterministic, no guessing (SEC registration; N-CEN next)
--   confirmed      — exact normalised-name Splink match (~95% precision)
--   candidate      — fuzzy name match, surfaced not asserted
--   ambiguous      — one exact name matched more than one entity
-- A deterministic edge always wins over a name-match for the same (key_type, key).
-- FIRST CUT — precedence + multi-grain shape are here; N-CEN registrant layer (§1c)
-- and cross-source dedup refinements are the next iteration (see README).

-- 1) Authoritative edges — OFFICIAL sources only (SEC + GLEIF). No crowd-sourced
--    data (Wikidata is kept out of the published pipeline; it's an out-of-band
--    validation cross-check only).

-- 2) Probabilistic name-match edges (operating-company tail), CIK grain. The resolver
--    is ticker-grained, so a multi-ticker company yields several identical (cik,lei)
--    rows — dedup to one edge, keeping the highest match probability. Drop any CIK
--    already covered by an authoritative edge (authoritative wins).
