-- The purchases a dashboard reads, one row per invoice that is not a cancellation and
-- has a positive value: its month, country and value, whether its customer was new
-- that month or returning, and how much history that label rests on. A customer's
-- first year in the data cannot tell a new customer from one who bought before the
-- data starts, which is what `customer_record` says.
